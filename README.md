# Energy-Efficiency-regression-task

A machine learning regression task consisting of analysing energy efficiecny.

The task is based on an energy efficiency prediction problem which is a regression problem. More specifically, to perform an analysis using different building shapes, with different characteristics, and predict the heating load of the building. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, the orientation, and other aspects comprised in the dataset.

This analysis comprised: data inspection and visualisation, data preprocessing including data splitting in 70% training data, and 30% test data, data transformations considered useful for this task, treatment of missing values, feature selection to achieve a better performance. The analysis includes developing the predictive models based on the following algorithms: simple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression. These models (except simple Linear Regression which needs only to be simply trained) were tuned using the training set. The training set was used to select the best 2 models.
